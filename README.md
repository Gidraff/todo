# Todo

Todo is an example application intended to serve as a vehicle for
illustrating microservices best practices.

Currently this illustrates the use of the ambassador plugin to enable
envoy to function in an API gateway role with domain specific edge
logic for authentication.

It also illustrates the use of forge to provide a natural workflow for
both early services under rapid development, as well as the
combination of forge and envoy to provide canary workflows for later
stage services.
